				<h2>Our email list is moving - you need to re-subscribe!</h2>
				<p>Good morning everyone in Hoosier-land.</p>

				<p>Spring is just about sproinging now, despite a bit of snow, and there are plenty of Hoosiers-shaped blossoms starting to appear.
				The first and biggest one is unfortunately the least exciting but also the MOST IMPORTANT: we're moving our email list!</p>

				<p>If you want to keep getting updates from us on new music, tour dates, other projects and updates, you will need to join our new email list here. We'll send a few more reminders before we shut down this one at the end of May, but want to make sure you DO sign up otherwise you may miss out on some big news.</p><!-- paragraph tags allow for styling and organisation -->

				<p>What KIND of big news? Well those spring-like blossoms may or may not include something to do with brand new music, something to do with summer festivals and shows, something to do with the theatre, something to do with a musical, and even something to do with the mystical far east. Does it sound exciting? Yes it does.</p>

				<p>So don't miss out, join our new, improved, fresher-scented email list and you'll be hearing more from us soon!</p>

				<h2>Thank-yous and Brown Thursday </h2>
				<p>Hello one and all...</p>

				<p>It seems like only yesterday we were stepping off stage at the end of the tour, but we've been in such a daze it's taken us this long to recover! What a TOE-MELTING tour it was, too... the fun, the frolics, the sights, the SMELLS!</p><!-- breaks used for speration of paragraphs -->

				<p>A massive thank you from all of us - me and Al, plus our loyal cohorts Bradders and General Zoe - you made it a tour of tours to be remembered. Let's do it again next year shall we??!!</p>

				<p>In the meantime the lovely people at the Komedia in Bath filmed the show (a standout for us) - have a look at Goodbye Mr. A and Pristine to reminisce (or see what you missed and prompt a few “self-refectory” questions).</p>

				<h2>Join The Hoosiers On Stage! </h2>
				<p>It's you chance to support us. And we don't just mean buying tickets to the 10th Anniversary tour so we can feed our children (budgie). We're offering you the chance to take to the stage on our upcoming tour!</p>

				<p>If you are a Karaoke king/queen ("Love and Pride"/"Who Wants to Live Forever" are both excellent options) all you have to do is reply to our post on Facebook including your name, the venue at which you will be seeing us, and your choice of karaoke tune. Crucially (and befitting of the evening's entertainment) you don't have to be that good...!</p><!--paragraph tags allow for styles -->

				<p>We will be picking and contacting winners in advance of each show in a Facebook love draw/announcement (details schmeetails). You get the drift.</p>
